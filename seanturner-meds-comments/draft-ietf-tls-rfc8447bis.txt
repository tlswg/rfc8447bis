1.  Introduction

   This document instructs IANA to make changes to a number of the IANA
   registries related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes update the changes
   made in [RFC8447].

      |  RFC EDITOR NOTE: Please remove the note that follows.

      |  NOTE for IANA: This document specifies changes to the registry
      |  to update the changes made in [RFC8447].

   This specification adds a new value "D" for discouraged to the
   Recommended column of the selected TLS registries and adds a
   "Comment" column to all active registries that do not already have a
   "Comment" column.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updating "Recommended" Column's Values

   The instructions in this document update the Recommended column,
   originally added in [RFC8447] to add a third value, "D", indicating
   that a value is "Discouraged".  The permitted values of the
   "Recommended" column are:

   Y:  Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
      RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is fit
      for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading of the
      documentation for the mechanism is necessary to understand the
      applicability of that mechanism.  The IETF could recommend
      mechanisms that have limited applicability, but will provide
      applicability statements that describe any limitations of the
      mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.

   N:  Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and
      that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the
      associated mechanism.  This does not necessarily mean that the
      mechanism is flawed, only that no consensus exists.  The IETF
      might have consensus to leave an items marked as "N" on the basis
      of its having limited applicability or usage constraints.

   D:  Indicates that the item is discouraged.  This marking could be
      used to identify mechanisms that might result in problems if they
      are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism
      that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.  When
      marking a registry entry as “D”, either the References or the
      Comments Column MUST include sufficient information to determine
      why the marking has been applied.  Implementers and users SHOULD
      consult the linked references associated with the item to
      determine the conditions under which the item SHOULD NOT or MUST
      NOT be used.

   Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from "Y" or
   "D" in the "Recommended" column requires IETF Standards Action or
   IESG Approval [RFC8126].  Not all items defined in Standards Track
   RFCs need to be set to "Y" or "D".  Any item not otherwise specified
   is set to "N".  The column is blank for values that are unassigned or
   reserved unless specifically set.

3.1.  Recommended Note

   Existing registries have a note on the meaning of the Recommended
   column.  For the registries discussed in the subsequent sections this
   note is updated with a sentence describing the "D" value as follows:

   Note:  If "Recommended" column is set to "N", it does not necessarily
      mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either
      has not been through the IETF consensus process, has limited
      applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.  If the
      "Recommended" column is set to "D" the item is discouraged and
      SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used, depending upon the situation;
      consult the item’s references for clarity.

4.  TLS ExtensionType Values

   In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as
   follows:

   *  Adjust the registration procedure related to setting the
      “Recommended” column as follows:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  IANA is requested to add a reference
      to this document for these entries.

           +=======+============================+=============+
           | Value | Extension                  | Recommended |
           +=======+============================+=============+
           | 4     | truncated_hmac             |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 53    | connection_id (deprecated) |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 40    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 46    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+

                                 Table 1

   *  Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

   *  For the truncated_hmac, add the following link to Reference
      column: https://www.iacr.org/archive/
      asiacrypt2011/70730368/70730368.pdf

   *  For the two Reserved values above, add the following link in the
      Reference column: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls-reg-
      review/5BD62HBFjo_AsW-Y8ohVuWEe1gI/

5.  TLS Cipher Suites Registry

   Several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use
   and are marked as "D".

   Ciphersuites that use NULL encryption do not provide the
   confidentiality normally expected of TLS.  Protocols and applications
   are often designed to require confidentiality as a security property.
   These ciphersuites MUST NOT be used in those cases.

   Ciphersuites marked as EXPORT use weak ciphers and were deprecated in
   TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].

   Cipher suites marked as anon do not provide any authentication and
   are vulnerable to on-path attacks and are deprecated in TLS 1.1
   [RFC4346].

   RC4 is a weak cipher and is deprecated in [RFC7465].

   DES and IDEA are not considered secure for general use and are
   deprecated in [RFC5469].  Nor is MD5 or SHA-1 and these are
   deprecated in [RFC9155].

   In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA is requested to update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as
   follows:

   *  Adjust the registration procedure related to setting the
      “Recommended” column as follows:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  IANA is requested to add a reference
      to this document for these entries.  This document does not make
      any changes to the DTLS-OK column.

6.  TLS Supported Groups

   In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA is requested to update the TLS Supported Groups registry as
   follows:

   *  Update the registration policy to include:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  IANA is requested to add a reference

                                  Table 4

   *  Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

   *  Remove the "Elliptic curve groups" note from the registration
      procedures table.

   *  For each of the entries above, add the following link to the
      Comment column:

      rfc8447bis-00

7.  TLS Exporter Labels Registry

   This document updates the registration procedure for the TLS Exporter
   Labels registry and updates the Recommended column allocation.  IANA
   is requested to update the TLS Exporter Labels Registry as follows:

   *  Change the registration procedure from Specification Required to
      Expert Review and update it to include:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries keep their existing Recommended column "Y" and "N" entries

   *  Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

   *  Update the note on the role of the expert reviewer as follows.

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in [RFC8447],
      Section 17.  Even though this registry does not require a
      specification, the designated expert [RFC8126] will strongly
      encourage registrants to provide a link to a publicly available
      specification.  An Internet-Draft (that is posted and never
      published as an RFC) or a document from another standards body,
      industry consortium, university site, etc. are suitable for these
      purposes.  The expert may provide more in-depth reviews, but their
      approval should not be taken as an endorsement of the exporter
      label.  The expert also verifies that the label is a string
      consisting of printable ASCII characters beginning with
      "EXPORTER".  IANA MUST also verify that one label is not a prefix
      of any other label.  For example, labels "key" or "master
      secretary" are forbidden.

8.  TLS Certificate Types

   In order to reflect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA is requested to update the TLS Certificate Types registry as
   follows:

   *  Adjust the registration procedure related to setting the
      “Recommended” column as follows:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries keep their existing Recommended column "Y" and "N"
      entries.

   *  Update note on the Recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

9.  TLS HashAlgorithm Registry

   Though TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 were deprecated [RFC8996], TLS 1.2 will be
   in use for some time.  In order to reflect the changes in the
   Recommended column allocation, IANA is requested to update the TLS
   HashAlgorithm Registry as follows:

   *  Update the registration procedure to include:

       Setting a value to "Y" or "D" or transitioning the value from
       "Y" or "D"  in the "Recommended" column requires
       IETF Standards Action or IESG Approval [RFC8126].

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the TLS HashAlgorithm registry to add a "Recommended"
      column as follows:

15.  Expert Review of Current and Potential IETF and IRTF Documents

   The intent of the Specification Required choice for TLS code points
   is to allow for easy registration for code points associated with
   protocols and algorithms that are not being actively developed inside
   IETF or IRTF.  When TLS-based technologies are being developed inside
   the IRTF/IETF they should be done in coordination with the TLS WG in
   order to provide appropriate review.  For this reason, unless the TLS
   WG chairs indicate otherwise via email, designated experts should
   decline code point registrations for documents which have already
   been adopted or are being proposed for adoption by IETF working
   groups or IRTF research groups.

16.  Security Considerations

   The change to Specification Required from IETF Review lowers the
   amount of review provided for cipher suites and supported groups.
   This change reflects reality in that the TLS WG essentially provided
   no cryptographic review of the cipher suites or supported groups.
   This was especially true of national cipher suites.

   Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
   time of registration; however, cryptographic algorithms and
   parameters will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that
   the "Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent
   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
   level of security.

   Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.
   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be
   taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported
   group, etc.

17.  IANA Considerations

   This document is entirely about changes to TLS-related IANA
   registries.
