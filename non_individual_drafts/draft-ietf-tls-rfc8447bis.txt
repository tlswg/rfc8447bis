1.  Introduction

   This document instructs IANA to make changes to a number of the IANA
   registries related to Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram
   Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  These changes update the changes
   made in [RFC8447].

      |  NOTE for IANA: This document specifies changes to the registry
      |  to update the changes made in [RFC8447].

   This specification updates the "Recommended" column in TLS registries
   to define a third value "D" for items that are discouraged.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Adding "Recommended" Column

   The instructions in this document update the Recommended column,
   originally added in [RFC8447] to add a third value, "D", indicating
   that a value is "Discouraged".  The permitted values are:

   Y:  Indicates that the IETF has consensus that the item is
      RECOMMENDED.  This only means that the associated mechanism is fit
      for the purpose for which it was defined.  Careful reading of the
      documentation for the mechanism is necessary to understand the
      applicability of that mechanism.  The IETF could recommend
      mechanisms that have limited applicability, but will provide
      applicability statements that describe any limitations of the
      mechanism or necessary constraints on its use.

   N:  Indicates that the item has not been evaluated by the IETF and
      that the IETF has made no statement about the suitability of the
      associated mechanism.  This does not necessarily mean that the
      mechanism is flawed, only that no consensus exists.  The IETF
      might have consensus to leave an items marked as "N" on the basis
      of it having limited applicability or usage constraints.

   D:  Indicates that the item is discouraged.  This marking could be
      used to identify mechanisms that might result in problems if they
      are used, such as a weak cryptographic algorithm or a mechanism
      that might cause interoperability problems in deployment.
      Implementers SHOULD consult the linked references associated with
      the item to determine the conditions under which it SHOULD NOT or
      MUST NOT be used.

   Setting a value to "Y" or "D" in the "Recommended" column requires
   IETF Standards Action [RFC8126].  Any state transition to or from a
   "Y" or "D" value requires IESG Approval.  Not all items defined in
   Standards Track RFCs need to be set to "Y" or "D".  Any item not
   otherwise specified is set to "N".  The column is blank for values
   that are unassigned or reserved unless specifically set.

3.1.  Recommended Note

   Existing registries have a note on the meaning of the recommended
   column.  For the registries discussed in the subsequent sections this
   note is updated with a sentence describing the "D" vaue as follows:

   Note:  If "Recommended" column is set to "N", it does not necessarily
      mean that it is flawed; rather, it indicates that the item either
      has not been through the IETF consensus process, has limited
      applicability, or is intended only for specific use cases.  If the
      "Recommended" column is set to "D" the item is discouraged and
      SHOULD NOT or MUST NOT be used.

4.  TLS ExtensionType Values

   In order to refect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA SHALL update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:

   *  Change the registration procedure to:

    Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are assigned
    via Specification Required [RFC8126].  Values with the first byte
    255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [RFC8126].  Setting a
    "Recommended" column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards Action [RFC8126].
    Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D" value requires
    IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  A reference to this document SHALL be
      added to these entries.

           +=======+============================+=============+
           | Value | Extension                  | Recommended |
           +=======+============================+=============+
           | 4     | truncated_hmac             |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 53    | connection_id (deprecated) |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 40    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+
           | 46    | Reserved                   |           D |
           +-------+----------------------------+-------------+

                                 Table 1

   *  Update note on the recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

5.  TLS Cipher Suites Registry

   Several categories of ciphersuites are discouraged for general use
   and are maked as "D".

   Ciphersuites that use NULL encryption do not provide the
   confidentiality normally expected of TLS.  Protocols and applications
   are often designed to require confidentialy as a security property.
   These ciphersuites MUST NOT be used in those cases.

   Ciphersuites marked as EXPORT use weak ciphers and were deprecated in
   TLS 1.1 [RFC4346].

   Cipher suites maked as anon do not provide any authentication and are
   vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and are deprecated in TLS 1.1
   [RFC4346].

   RC4 is a weak cipher and is deprecated in [RFC7465].

   DES and IDEA are not considered secure for general use and are
   deprecated in [RFC5469].

   In order to refect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA SHALL update the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as follows:

   *  Change the registration procedure to:

    Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 (decimal) are
    assigned via Specification Required [RFC8126].  Values with the
    first byte 255 (decimal) are reserved for Private Use [RFC8126].
    Setting a "Recommended" column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards
    Action [RFC8126]. Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D"
    value requires IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the
      entries in following table.  A reference to this document SHALL be
      added to these entries.  This document does not make any changes
      to the DTLS-OK column.

   *  Update note on the recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

6.  TLS Supported Groups

   In order to refect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA SHALL update the TLS Supported Groups registry as follows:

   *  Update the registration policy to include:

    Setting a "Recommended" column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards
    Action [RFC8126]. Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D"
    value requires IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the "Recommended" column with the changes as listed below.
      Entries keep their existing "Y" and "N" entries except for the

                                  Table 3

   *  Update note on the recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

7.  TLS Exporter Labels Registry

   This document updates the registration procedure for the TLS Exporter
   registry and updates the Recommended column allocation.  IANA SHALL
   update the TLS Exporter Labels Registry as follows:

   *  Change the registration procedure from Specification Required to
      Expert Review and update it to include:

    Setting a "Recommended" column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards
    Action [RFC8126]. Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D"
    value requires IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries keep their existing Recommended column "Y" and "N" entries

   *  Update note on the recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

   *  update the note on the role of the expert reviewer as follows.

   Note:  The role of the designated expert is described in [RFC8447].
      Even though this registry does not require a specification, the
      designated expert [RFC8126] will strongly encourage registrants to
      provide a link to a publicly available specification.  An
      Internet-Draft (that is posted and never published as an RFC) or a
      document from another standards body, industry consortium,
      university site, etc. are suitable for these purposes.  The expert
      may provide more in-depth reviews, but their approval should not
      be taken as an endorsement of the exporter label.  The expert also
      verifies that the label is a string consisting of printable ASCII
      characters beginning with "EXPORTER".  IANA MUST also verify that
      one label is not a prefix of any other label.  For example, labels
      "key" or "master secretary" are forbidden.

8.  TLS Certificate Types

   In order to refect the changes in the Recommended column allocation,
   IANA SHALL update the the TLS Certificate Types registry as follows:

   *  Change the registration procedure to:

      Values in the range 0-223 (decimal) are assigned via Specification
      Required [RFC8126]. Values in the range 224-255 (decimal) are
      reserved for Private Use [RFC8126]. Setting a "Recommended" column
      value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards
      Action [RFC8126]. Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D"
      value requires IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Entries keep their existing Recommended column "Y" and "N"
      entries.

   *  Update note on the recommended column with text in Section 3.1.

9.  TLS HashAlgorithm Registry

   Though TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 were deprecated [RFC8996], TLS 1.2 will be
   in use for some time.  In order to refect the changes in the
   Recommended column allocation, IANA SHALL update the TLS
   HashAlgorithm Registry registry as follows:

   *  Update the registration procedure to include:

    Setting a "Recommended" column value to "Y" or "D" requires Standards
    Action [RFC8126]. Any state transition to or from a "Y" or "D"
    value requires IESG Approval.

   *  Add a reference to this document under the reference heading.

   *  Update the TLS HashAlgorithm registry to add a "Recommended"
      column as follows:

14.  Expert Review of Current and Potential IETF and IRTF Documents

   The intent of the Specification Required standard for TLS code points
   is to allow for easy registration for code points associated with
   protocols and algorithms that are not being actively developed inside
   IETF or IRTF.  When TLS-based technologies are being developed inside
   the IRTF/IETF they should be done in coordination with the TLS WG in
   order to provide appropriate review.  For this reason, designated
   experts should discourage code point registrations for documents
   which have already been adoption or are being proposed for adopted by
   IETF working groups or IRTF research groups.

15.  Security Considerations

   The change to Specification Required from IETF Review lowers the
   amount of review provided by the WG for cipher suites and supported
   groups.  This change reflects reality in that the WG essentially
   provided no cryptographic review of the cipher suites or supported
   groups.  This was especially true of national cipher suites.

   Recommended algorithms are regarded as secure for general use at the
   time of registration; however, cryptographic algorithms and
   parameters will be broken or weakened over time.  It is possible that
   the "Recommended" status in the registry lags behind the most recent
   advances in cryptanalysis.  Implementers and users need to check that
   the cryptographic algorithms listed continue to provide the expected
   level of security.

   Designated experts ensure the specification is publicly available.
   They may provide more in-depth reviews.  Their review should not be
   taken as an endorsement of the cipher suite, extension, supported
   group, etc.

16.  IANA Considerations

   This document is entirely about changes to TLS-related IANA
   registries.
